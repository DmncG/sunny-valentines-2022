          I know you'd rather get letters than receive flowers so instead of sending you a postcard or letter, I made a website instead (I'm playing to my strengths lol).

        I hope you're doing well in Las Vegas. I'm sure you're still having so much fun despite how busy you are. I hope you're still icing and taping that ankle. I'm still worried that I made you walk too much during your visit.
        </p>

        Only a month or so before we go on a date again! Can't wait to go to the beach with you. I miss you!

          P.S. I was tempted to write all this in Korean but Google translate is too formal therefore, not cool lol. See you soon!
